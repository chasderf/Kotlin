fun main() { 
  println("Hello World") 
}



#The fun keyword is used to declare a function. A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. In the example above, it declares the main() function.

#The main() function is something you will see in every Kotlin program. This function is used to execute code. Any code inside the main() function's curly brackets {} will be executed.

#For example, the println() function is inside the main() function, meaning that this will be executed. The println() function is used to output/print text, and in our example it will output "Hello World".
